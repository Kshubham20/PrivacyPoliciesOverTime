We do not have the full implementation of the classifier. However, the [Information Systems Research Lab @ HSLU](https://www.hslu.ch/en/lucerne-school-of-information-technology/research/distributed-ledger-technology/) has re-implemented our classifier and obtained similar results. You can find their project [here](https://gitlab.enterpriselab.ch/ashankar/policy-classifier).
