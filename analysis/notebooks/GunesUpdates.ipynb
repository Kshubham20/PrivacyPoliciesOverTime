      "Personally identifiable information refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on our Sites, such as registering for an account, purchasing a product, submitting content and/or posting content on any of our blogs, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. Examples of personally identifiable information may include your first and last name, email address, mailing address, telephone numbers, age group, gender and other identifying information. When setting up your profile on our Sites, you may be asked to provide an e-mail address, phone number, and address.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aggregate information refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our Sites, and what other sites may have directed you to us. This information, which is collected in a variety of different ways, is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This technology enables us to determine (i) your IP Address of your computer and its geographic location from installing the Applications onto your computer, mobile device or through your GPS of your mobile device; (ii) your search terms or interactive behavior via BNI’s websites; (iii) your purchasing behavior; (iv) source of the information sought by you during your search; and (v) the age of your results data (collectively, “Shared Information”).  We may use the information you provide in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing marketing plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "B.        Other Information You Provide. We may also collect and store any personal information you enter on our Sites or provide to us in some other manner, including personal information that may be contained in any comment you post to our Sites. This includes identifying information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number (if provided and applicable); your likeness (both still and moving); and, if you transact business with us or our partner, limited financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information).\n",

This data is used in the legitimate interests of members, for the purposes of generating their invitations to non-members to Chapter meetings and other BNI events, and for business-to-business referrals between members for the potential purchase of goods or services from non‑members.\n",
      "\n",
      "D.        Sweepstakes and Contests. When  BNI offers sweepstakes or contests, personal information is collected with the sole purpose of notifying you if you win the sweepstakes or contest.\n",

Accordingly, Booktopia Pty Ltd will review and update its policies as required.

      "  ### Pricing Policy\n",
      "  \n",
      "  All prices are listed in Australian dollars and are inclusive of GST. If placing an order from outside Australia you will be charged in your own currency at the conversion rate of your credit card company.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  All prices on the Booktopia website are for orders placed via the website only. Orders placed by phone, fax (only for orders not with a Booktopia order number), in person at our office or by mail order will be charged the full RRP prices quoted on the website plus a $10 non-refundable administration fee as they will need to be hand processed by Booktopia staff.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  All orders are subject to price and availability confirmation. If we cannot supply the product for the originally advertised price then Booktopia will do one of two things.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  If the increase in price is marginal then Booktopia will absorb the increase and proceed with the order and adjust the price on the website after processing your order.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  If the price is significantly more then we will not proceed until we have consulted with the customer via the message centre in your Booktopia account and outlined the options. The customer will not be charged for that item until Booktopia has been given confirmation to proceed with the new price. You have 48 hours to respond to the options given to you. If you respond after this time frame, you will be asked to place a new order through the website. If there are other titles on the order that are readily available then they will be automatically ordered, regardless of what percentage of the order they make up.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Booktopia are not obligated to sell a title at the listed price if we are not able to source it from our supplier at the time of ordering as prices may have changed in the interim. In all instances you will be contacted via the message centre in your Booktopia account if there is a change of price and Booktopia will endeavour to find an alternative edition for the same price or discuss the possibility of purchasing the same title at the new price.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- We reserve the right to correct any printing errors.\n",

      "+ ### Online Abuse Policy\n",
      "+ \n",
      "+ As an online bookstore with millions of books from around the world, there is always the likelihood to display and sell content, from an ever-changing landscape of publishers and authors, that can insult or offend someone or some groups - even the most seemingly-benign content. On our websites, we take the approach of selling entertainment and knowledge and enabling free speech and freedom of opinions and expression through books, but not at the expense of, or in specific danger to, our democratic and societal protections, rights and freedoms - particularly those of safety, security and religious, political or civil association. Google is famous for having a mantra of \"Don't Be Evil\" and we agree with that sentiment when it comes to books (unless you are Stephen King in which case context definitely counts, but that's the point!).\n",
      "+ \n",
      "+ Booktopia itself has policies to address racism, bullying and hate within our company and we extend that for our websites, within the relevant Laws and what would be judged in an expected, reasonable manner. We do our best to swiftly assess and respond to reports of prohibited or illegal content on our website that falls foul of these Laws and principles, just as we so choose not to remove content that does not, according to our judgement and within the Law.\n",
      "+ \n",
      "+ What is Prohibited or Illegal content?\n",
      "+ \n",
      "+ The Office of the eSafety Commissioner of the Australian Government describes the following types of content that may be Prohibited or Illegal:\n",
      "+ \n",
      "+   * footage of real or simulated violence, criminal activity or accidents from video clips, games or films\n",
      "+   * sexually explicit content\n",
      "+   * images of child sexual abuse\n",
      "+   * content that advocates the doing of a terrorist act\n",
      "+   * content instructing or promoting crime or violence.\n",
      "+ \n",
      "+ \n",
      "+ \n",
      "+ We expand this list to also include racism, bullying and harassment specifically and intently directed at people as well as other types of content. We have content and categories where lines definitely are drawn at different places within this list - including zero tolerance in many - in considered, educational or non-harming contexts and that we believe is a reasonable and acceptable way to behave in our society. \n",
      "+ \n",
      "+ What we are saying is that we do not automatically take content down just because you don't like or agree with it, but we do take content down that is reasonably or obviously harmful.\n",
      "+ \n",
      "+ Good examples of content we do allow are books about topics that are widely accepted as educational resources, yet can be potentially offensive; for example most medical, religious and historical books would fit into this category (obviously not an exhaustive list) and there will always be a person or persons who demand that we take that content down, yet we do not. Examples of books we have taken down are bomb-making or other terrorism-related instruction manuals and explicitly-overt sexual, homophobic, bigoted or racist content specifically directed at a person, group or groups of people for the intent to cause harm. Intent and context of the book is important. Even so, we believe we can safely fulfil the wider reading needs in our society within the Law, yet without being necessarily or automatically held hostage to causes or people who would demand us to act in a way that would enforce their own views onto us and our readers. At the end of the day we take a non-radical, lawful and reasonable approach to what we sell and display on our websites and we do not tolerate Cyber Abuse.\n",
      "+ \n",
      "+ What is Cyber Abuse?\n",
      "+ \n",
      "+ The Office of the eSafety Commissioner of the Australian Government defines Cyber abuse as online behaviour which is reasonably likely to have a seriously threatening, intimidating, harassing or humiliating effect on a person. It is behaviour that threatens to hurt a person socially, psychologically or even physically. As above, we have a very low tolerance for this type of content and we welcome you to report it to us.\n",
      "+ \n",
      "+ Have something on our website to report?\n",
      "+ \n",
      "+ Please send an email to abuse@booktopia.com.au We will consider your view and if we deem it appropriate to act, then we will do so.\n",

      "  \n",
      "  The images on our website are intended as a guide only. As Booktopia does not keep every title in stock on site we are unable to guarantee the cover image that arrives from the supplier, will be that listed on the site. Publishers can have various cover designs for one ISBN so images can change without notification.\n",

      "  \n",

      "    2. If you have changed your mind, or made a mistake, we require notification within 2 business days of the recorded delivery date.\n",
      "    3. If you received a faulty or damaged item, we require notification within 2 business days of the recorded delivery date.\n",
      "    4. If the item you received is not what you ordered, we require notification within 5 business days of the recorded delivery date.\n",
      "    5. Booktopia is NOT obligated to offer a store credit for products that are returned damaged to our Distribution Centre or never arrive. The Booktopia Distribution Centre address is: Unit E1, 3-29 Birnie Avenue, Lidcombe, NSW 2141. To qualify for a credit an item must be returned in perfect condition ready to be resold. Failure to package a returning item properly will undoubtedly result in no store credit and the product will be returned to the customer.\n",
      "    6. A store credit issued for a return will be for the value of the returned item only. A store credit for a specific item does not cover the cost of postage.\n",

      "\n",

      "This Privacy Notice (“Notice”) sets out how Top Deck Tours Ltd, a company incorporated in the United Kingdom, and its associated bodies corporate and franchisees worldwide (collectively referred to in this document as “Topdeck”, “we” “our” or “us”) protects the privacy of your personal information. \n",
      "\n",
      "Top Deck is part of the Flight Centre Travel Group, one of the world's largest travel agency groups. We need to collect, use and disclose personal information in order to perform our business functions and activities, including making and managing travel bookings on behalf of our customers. We are firmly committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information and to maintaining various physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect personal information in our care.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”) we will be either the “data processor” or “data controller” for any personal information you provide to us in connection with our relationship. The precise role we will be assuming is dependent on the context of our relationship with you and the purpose of the processing being undertaken.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the provision of retail travel services by Top Deck, we will be the data controller and this Notice shall apply. Likewise, for the purpose of all our marketing activities (both business travel/event management and retail travel services) we will be the data controller and this Notice shall apply.\n",
      "\n",
      "By providing personal information to us, you agree that this Notice will apply to how we handle your personal information and you consent to us collecting, using and disclosing your personal information as detailed in this Notice. If you do not agree with any part of this Notice, you must not provide your personal information to us. If you do not provide us with your personal information, or if you withdraw a consent that you have given under this Notice, this may affect our ability to provide services to you or negatively impact the services we can provide to you. For example, most travel bookings must be made under the traveller's full name and must include contact details and appropriate identification (e.g. passport details). We cannot make bookings for you without that information.There may be instances where your local data protection laws impose more restrictive information handling practices than the practices set out in this Notice. Where this occurs we will adjust our information handling practices in your jurisdiction to comply with these local data protection laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "  2. What personal information do we collect?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Personal information has the meaning given under your local data protection law, and, where the GDPR applies, the meaning of personal data given under the GDPR. Personal information generally means information which relates to a living individual who can be identified from that information, or from that information and other information in a person’s possession, including any expression of opinion, whether true or not, and whether recorded in material form or not, about an identified or reasonably identifiable individual, and any indication of intention in respect of an individual. \n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, the type of personal information we collect about you is the information that is needed to facilitate your travel arrangements and bookings and to arrange travel related services and/or products on your behalf.\n",
      "\n",
      "We therefore typically process the following types of personal information about you:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * contact information (such as name, residential/mailing address, telephone number, email address);\n",
      "  * payment account information (credit/debit card details, including card type, card number, security number and expiry date);\n",
      "  * passport details;\n",
      "  * loyalty program / frequent flyer details;\n",
      "  * information about your dietary requirements and health issues (if any); and\n",
      "  * other details relevant to your travel arrangements or required by the relevant travel service providers (e.g. airlines and accommodation or tour providers).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When you make contact with us for other purposes, we may also collect personal information about you in relation to those purposes. For example, we may collect your personal information so we can contact you about a competition you have entered (e.g. if you win) or to respond to an enquiry or feedback you have sent to us. We also collect information that is required for use in the business activities of Topdeck and our related entities, including for example, financial details necessary in order to process various transactions, video surveillance footage used for security purposes, and other relevant personal information you may elect to provide to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some circumstances, we may collect personal information from you which may be regarded as sensitive information under your local data protection laws. Sensitive information may include (without limitation) your racial or ethnic origin, philosophical or religious beliefs or affiliations, sexual preferences or practices, criminal record and the alleged commission of an offence, membership of political, professional or trade associations, biometric and genetic information, passwords and financial information and health information, and (in the USA) any personal information relating to a child under the age of 13. We will only collect sensitive information in compliance with your local data protection laws, with your explicit consent and where it is reasonably necessary for, or directly related to, one or more of our functions or activities (e.g. to make travel arrangements), unless we are otherwise required or authorised to do so by law. To the extent permitted or required under your local data protection laws, you consent to us using and disclosing your sensitive information for the purpose for which it was collected, unless we subsequently receive your consent to use it for another purpose. For example, if you provide health information to us in connection with a travel insurance application you would like to make, you consent to us using and disclosing that health information in connection with arranging that travel insurance on your behalf. A further example is if you disclose your religious beliefs to us because you are interested in, for example, certain holiday packages, in which case you consent to us using and disclosing that information in connection with facilitating your request. We will not use sensitive information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, unless we subsequently receive your consent to use it for another purpose.\n",

      "  3. How do we collect personal information?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We will only collect personal information in compliance with your local data protection laws. We usually collect your personal information from the information you submit during the course of your relationship with us. We will collect this information directly from you unless it is unreasonable or impracticable to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, this collection will occur:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * when you deal with us either in person, by telephone, letter, email;\n",
      "  * when you visit any of our websites; or\n",
      "  * when you connect with us via social media.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We may collect personal information about you:\n",

      "  * when you purchase or make enquiries about travel arrangements or other products and services;\n",
      "  * when you enter competitions or register for promotions;\n",
      "  * when you subscribe to receive marketing from us (e.g. e-newsletters);\n",
      "  * when you request brochures or other information from us; or\n",
      "  * when you provide information, or use our services, on social media.\n",
      "\n",

      "Unless you choose to do so under a pseudonym or anonymously, we may also collect your personal information (other than sensitive information) when you complete surveys or provide us with feedback. \n",
      "\n",
      "In some circumstances, it may be necessary for us to collect personal information about you from a third party. This includes where a person makes a travel booking on your behalf which includes travel arrangements to be used by you (e.g. a family or group booking or a travel booking made for you by your employer). Where this occurs, we will rely on the authority of the person making the travel booking to act on behalf of any other traveller on the booking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where you make a travel booking on behalf of another person (e.g. a family or group booking or a travel booking made for an employee), you agree you have obtained the consent of the other person for Topdeck to collect, use and disclose the other person's personal information in accordance with this Notice and that you have otherwise made the other person aware of this Notice. \n",
      "\n",
      "You should let us know immediately if you become aware that your personal information has been provided to us by another person without your consent or if you did not obtain consent before providing another person's personal information to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "We make every effort to maintain the accuracy and completeness of your personal information which we store and to ensure all of your personal information is up to date. However, you can assist us with this considerably by promptly contacting us if there are any changes to your personal information or if you become aware that we have inaccurate personal information relating to you (see section 13 below). We will not be responsible for any losses arising from any inaccurate, inauthentic, deficient or incomplete personal information that you, or a person acting on your behalf, provide to us.\n",

      "  4. How do we use your personal information?\n",

      "\n",
      "We will only process your information, where:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * you have given your consent to such processing (which you may withdraw at any time, as detailed at section 8 below);\n",
      "  * the processing is necessary to provide our services to you;\n",
      "  * the processing is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations; and/or\n",

      "\n",
      "In detail: Where you contact us in relation to a travel booking or query, the purpose for which we collect your personal information is generally to provide you with travel advice and/or to assist you with booking travel and/or travel related products and services. However, the purpose for collection may differ depending on the particular circumstances as disclosed in this Notice (e.g. collection of your personal information for the purpose of your participation in a competition, provision of feedback, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "When you book or otherwise arrange travel related products and services through us, we usually act as an agent for the relevant travel service providers (e.g. for a hotel). In this case, we process your personal information as necessary so as to provide the services you requested from us. This usually includes collecting personal information about you both for our internal purposes as described in this Notice and for the travel service provider for whom we act as agent (e.g. to provide you with the booked services). For example, if you book a flight through us, then we use your personal information to enable your flight to be booked and disclose it to the airline to enable the airline to provide the flight service to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may therefore share your information with our travel service providers such as hotel, airline, car rental, or other providers, who fulfill your travel bookings. Please note that these travel service providers also may use your personal information as described in their respective privacy policy and may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you, facilitate your travel reservation, or provide you with your requested services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party travel service providers whose products you purchase through us. We will provide you with copies of all relevant travel service provider terms, conditions and privacy policies on request. \n",
      "\n",
      "We act as agent for or on behalf of many thousands of travel service providers around the world, so it is not possible for us to set out in this Notice all of the travel service providers for whom we act or their locations. For more information about the disclosure of personal information to travel service providers located overseas, please refer to section 6 below.\n",
