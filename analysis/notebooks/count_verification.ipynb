      "\n",
      "Naturally, the aggregate statistics that describe our print and online audience, which is often based on the information you provide when you subscribe, register, or browse our sites, help us sell advertising and otherwise publicize Ziff Davis and its brands. \n",

      "###### Mailing Lists\n",
      "\n",
      "We make email and postal lists of our customers available on a rental basis, to carefully screened providers of quality goods and services. Many customers appreciate the offerings they receive, but here's what to do if you don't wish for us to share this information:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * If you are a subscriber to a Ziff Davis magazine and would prefer that your contact information not be provided to third parties, please log in and change your preferences at http://subhelp.ziffdavis.com.

      "Ziff Davis also provides profile reports on specific companies, based on subscriber-reported and publicly available data, to carefully screened providers of quality goods and services. These include contact information for the company and its key personnel.\n",
      "\n",
      "###### Email and Postal Mail Deployment, Data Analysis and Other Data Services\n",
      "\n",
      "We provide customer lists and other information to third party companies who provide specialized services, such as email message deployment, merge-purge (identifying and removing duplicate addresses), postal mailing, subscription fulfillment, customer service and telemarketing, research, statistical analysis, hosting and other data and transaction processing. These companies work on our behalf and we do not provide our lists or other data to them for their own, permanent use. Please note that we may provide certain personal information (including credit card information) directly to third parties solely for the purpose of processing sales of subscriptions or other services through our sites, and that such third parties' collection and use of that information shall be governed by such third party's own privacy policy. In addition, we may enter into agreements with certain reputable third parties to \"enhance\" the data they already possess about certain individuals, as a result of which if such a third party already possesses certain personally identifiable information about you, we may provide that third party with other personally identifiable information about you in our possession.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we also may provide to other companies lists of customers who have opted-out of email promotion for Ziff Davis or other products, so these customers can be suppressed from mailings those companies send on Ziff Davis's behalf. In addition, if you unsubscribe from a mailing we send to our own list on behalf of a third party, your removal instruction may also be supplied to the third party and added to their own suppression file.\n",

As another example, cookies can be used to control the number of times you see advertisements, like pop-ups. By allowing us to better understand how users interact with the site over time, cookies also help us improve your experience and deliver more relevant content to you. Cookies may be created directly by our sites for these purposes, or by third-party companies operating on our behalf.

Pixel tags are sometimes used in conjunction with small Javascript-based applications, also for the purpose of traffic measurement. We may also implement pixel tags provided by other companies for the same purpose. You can disable pixel tags by changing your browser settings to omit images and disable Javascript; or there are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most advertisements.\n",

      "Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel or clear-pixel gifs) are invisible images that are used to assign cookies or access cookies assigned previously to a visitor's computer. We use Web beacons to access information about the pages visitors are viewing so we can recognize our returning users and analyze traffic patterns.

This session information does not identify you personally and does not include your name, address, email address, telephone number or other Personal Information. We use this information to help us measure traffic and user behavior and count the number of unique visitors who view particular pages within our Site. If you wish to learn more about Omniture's privacy practices, you can visit http://www.omniture.com/privacy/product for more information.

Please note that you will need to opt-out separately before visiting our Site each time that you clear your cookies from your web browser or switch to a different computer or browser (e.g., if you previously opted-out of the use of Web beacons for us to collect and analyze your session data using the FireFox web browser but later visit our site using the Internet Explorer web browser, you will need to once again opt-out of the Web beacons). We use an advertising server developed by a third party to display ads on the Site. Some of these ads may contain cookies or Web beacons that are sent by third parties (e.g., advertisers or their advertising agencies) that we do not control. If you have questions regarding the data collection practices of any of the advertisers that appear on our Site, we encourage you to contact the applicable advertiser or review its privacy policy, which should be posted on the advertiser's website.\n",

Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by other computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you want to view) can be transmitted to you. We also use IP address information for systems administration and trouble shooting purposes. Your IP address does not tell us who you are. We use this information and cookies (see section below on cookies) to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our Site to the interests of our visitors, and to measure traffic within our Site. When you submit a query using a search tool on our Site or click on a search result, we may also share your IP address, browser level information and other anonymous information, such as a cookie identification code, with any third-party vendors that provide us with search functionality for our Site.\n",

      "To help make our Site more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we use a standard feature of browser software, called a \"cookie,\" to assign each visitor a unique, random numerical identification code that resides on their computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie can't read unrelated data off your hard drive. Our advertisers and the third parties that provide products or services through our Site may also assign their own cookies to your browser, a process that we don't control.\n",

      "Overall, the use of cookies helps to give you a more personalized experience at the Site. The information is used to keep our Site fresh and relevant to you the user. Cookies also identify you to our server, allowing you to avoid retyping your e-mail address and password each time you access the Site.\n",

      "You may decline to accept cookies sent by the Site by selecting an option on your browser to reject cookies.

Cookies enable our server to know that you are a registered user, and will eliminate the need for you to log in each time you access our Site. \n",

      "What are Web Beacons?   \n",
      "Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel or clear-pixel gifs) are invisible images that are used to assign cookies or access cookies assigned previously to a visitor's computer. We use Web beacons to access information about the pages visitors are viewing so we can recognize our returning users and analyze traffic patterns. We also work with a leading web analytics firm, Omniture, that places Web beacons on our Site and uses them in combination with cookies to collect, aggregate and analyze anonymous tracking information called \"session\" data on our behalf. This session information does not identify you personally and does not include your name, address, email address, telephone number or other Personal Information. We use this information to help us measure traffic and user behavior and count the number of unique visitors who view particular pages within our Site. If you wish to learn more about Omniture's privacy practices, you can visit http://www.omniture.com/privacy/product for more information. If you want to opt-out from the collection and analysis of your session data or if you want to uninstall an opt-out cookie from a prior visit (i.e., if you change your mind and decide to opt-in again to allow us to collect and analyze your session data), click here. Please note that you will need to opt-out separately before visiting our Site each time that you clear your cookies from your web browser or switch to a different computer or browser (e.g., if you previously opted-out of the use of Web beacons for us to collect and analyze your session data using the FireFox web browser but later visit our site using the Internet Explorer web browser, you will need to once again opt-out of the Web beacons). We use an advertising server developed by a third party to display ads on the Site. Some of these ads may contain cookies or Web beacons that are sent by third parties (e.g., advertisers or their advertising agencies) that we do not control. If you have questions regarding the data collection practices of any of the advertisers that appear on our Site, we encourage you to contact the applicable advertiser or review its privacy policy, which should be posted on the advertiser's website.\n",

If you choose to use these optional services or features, we may provide some of your Personal Information to one or more of our Service Providers. We will not do so without telling you in advance, and you can avoid having us make such disclosures by choosing not to use these services or features of the Site.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may provide to us offline or through any means other than this Site. For example, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information you provide when you subscribe by postal mail or telephone to one of our newspapers or to information that you provide to us at a live event or when you respond by postal mail or telephone to a survey or an invitation to enter a sweepstakes. These examples are not meant to be exhaustive, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to many other instances in which we may collect information from you offline. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our online privacy practices. By visiting this Site, you agree that your visit, and any dispute over our online privacy practices, is governed by this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.

      "### What Types of Information Do We Collect?\n",
      "\n",
      "The information we gather falls into two categories: (1) information (for example, your name, email address and mailing address) that you voluntarily supply when you register or initiate transactions on the Site, and (2) information gathered on usage patterns and preferences as you navigate through our Site, use our services, or read our email newsletters. In some cases, it is an agent or vendor of ours that collects the information on our behalf. Third-party providers featured on or linked to by our Site may be gathering the same kinds of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Registration Information   \n",
      "While visiting the Site, we may ask you to register and/or provide information that personally identifies you (\"Personal Information\"). Such Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, mailing address, and e-mail address. On any page that collects Personal Information, we will describe what information is required to provide you with the product or service you request or to respond to your inquiry or comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "IP Addresses and Browser Level Information  \n",
      "Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer configuration when you visit our Site, including the type of browser software you use, the operating system you're running, the resolution of your computer monitor, the website that referred you to our Site and your IP address. Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by other computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you want to view) can be transmitted to you. We also use IP address information for systems administration and trouble shooting purposes. Your IP address does not tell us who you are. We use this information and cookies (see section below on cookies) to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our Site to the interests of our visitors, and to measure traffic within our Site. When you submit a query using a search tool on our Site or click on a search result, we may also share your IP address, browser level information and other anonymous information, such as a cookie identification code, with any third-party vendors that provide us with search functionality for our Site.\n",
      "\n",
      "### What Are Cookies and Web Beacons and Why Do We Use Them? \n",
      "\n",
      "What are Cookies?   \n",
      "To help make our Site more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we use a standard feature of browser software, called a \"cookie,\" to assign each visitor a unique, random numerical identification code that resides on their computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie can't read unrelated data off your hard drive. Our advertisers and the third parties that provide products or services through our Site may also assign their own cookies to your browser, a process that we don't control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why does the Site use cookies?  \n",
      "We use cookies to track usage of the Site and further personalize your experience when you are visiting the Site. By tracking usage, we can best determine what features of the Site best serve our users. \n",
      "\n",
      "What benefits do I receive from cookies?   \n",
      "Overall, the use of cookies helps to give you a more personalized experience at the Site. The information is used to keep our Site fresh and relevant to you the user. Cookies also identify you to our server, allowing you to avoid retyping your e-mail address and password each time you access the Site.\n",
      "\n",
      "May I decline to accept a cookie?   \n",
      "You may decline to accept cookies sent by the Site by selecting an option on your browser to reject cookies. However, features of the Site that require registration will not be accessible to you. Cookies enable our server to know that you are a registered user, and will eliminate the need for you to log in each time you access our Site. \n",
      "\n",
      "What are Web Beacons?   \n",
      "Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel or clear-pixel gifs) are invisible images that are used to assign cookies or access cookies assigned previously to a visitor's computer. We use Web beacons to access information about the pages visitors are viewing so we can recognize our returning users and analyze traffic patterns. We also work with a leading web analytics firm, Omniture, that places Web beacons on our Site and uses them in combination with cookies to collect, aggregate and analyze anonymous tracking information called \"session\" data on our behalf. This session information does not identify you personally and does not include your name, address, email address, telephone number or other Personal Information. We use this information to help us measure traffic and user behavior and count the number of unique visitors who view particular pages within our Site. If you wish to learn more about Omniture's privacy practices, you can visit http://www.omniture.com/privacy/product for more information. If you want to opt-out from the collection and analysis of your session data or if you want to uninstall an opt-out cookie from a prior visit (i.e., if you change your mind and decide to opt-in again to allow us to collect and analyze your session data), click here. Please note that you will need to opt-out separately before visiting our Site each time that you clear your cookies from your web browser or switch to a different computer or browser (e.g., if you previously opted-out of the use of Web beacons for us to collect and analyze your session data using the FireFox web browser but later visit our site using the Internet Explorer web browser, you will need to once again opt-out of the Web beacons). We use an advertising server developed by a third party to display ads on the Site. Some of these ads may contain cookies or Web beacons that are sent by third parties (e.g., advertisers or their advertising agencies) that we do not control. If you have questions regarding the data collection practices of any of the advertisers that appear on our Site, we encourage you to contact the applicable advertiser or review its privacy policy, which should be posted on the advertiser's website.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Do We Use Your Personal Information?  \n",
      "We believe we can enhance your experience on our Site with the information you share with us. We use Personal Information to improve our advertising and marketing efforts, to statistically analyze Site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to personalize the Site's content, layout, and services. We will use your Personal Information to respond to your comments and questions. We may also use your Personal Information, such as your e-mail address, phone number or mailing address, to contact you regarding products and/or services that we think may be of interest to you, including products and services of third parties, unless you have elected not to receive these promotions and offers by modifying your profile as described below in \"How Can You Opt-Out of Sharing Your Personal Information or Receiving Our Promotional Communications?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We may match Personal Information we collect on the Site with other information about you supplied by third parties so that we can provide you with customized product and content offerings that we believe will interest you and to otherwise improve our advertising and marketing efforts. After registering on the Site, you may receive communications including mail, email, telephone or wireless short text messages from us related to products and services that we believe will interest you. Although we hope you find these communications informative and useful, you can always opt-out from receiving these types of communications from us by changing the privacy preferences in your member profile or by deleting your profile from our database. Please refer to \"How Can You Opt-Out of Sharing Your Personal Information or Receiving Our Promotional Communications?\" for additional information and instructions. \n",
      "\n",
      "### With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Affiliated Companies  \n",
      "We may share the information, including Personal Information, that we collect through the Site with any company that is directly or indirectly owned, controlled or operated by Belo so that we and they can communicate with you about products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. The use and further disclosure of the information collected on this Site by our affiliated companies will be governed by this Privacy Policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vendor and Service Providers  \n",
      "We have today, and will in the future have, arrangements with third-party vendors, such as credit card processors, shipping companies and fulfillment services that assist us with the operation of the Site or the services we offer through the Site. Occasionally, we will hire a third party to act on our behalf for projects such as market-research surveys and contest-entry or sweepstakes-entry processing. When you sign up for a service we offer, initiate a transaction, complete a survey or enter a contest or sweepstakes, we may be required to share Personal Information with one or more of our vendors. To protect your privacy, we do not authorize our vendors to retain, use or disclose your Personal Information for any purpose unrelated to the services that they provide for us or our users. To make our Site more valuable to our visitors, we may offer some services and features in conjunction with other service providers (\"Service Providers\"). For example, we may offer a car buying service, personalized finance and weather information alerts, sweepstakes offers or other promotions through cooperative arrangements with Service Providers that specialize in operating such services and features. If you choose to use these optional services or features, we may provide some of your Personal Information to one or more of our Service Providers. We will not do so without telling you in advance, and you can avoid having us make such disclosures by choosing not to use these services or features of the Site. Some of these Service Providers may also collect their own Personal Information in connection with providing the service. Their use of your information will be subject to the terms of their respective privacy policies, which you can find on their websites or obtain by contacting the Service Providers directly. Please refer to \"Who is the Party Collecting Your Personal Information?\" for additional information. \n",
      "\n",
      "Statistical Information  \n",
      "Much of the information we collect is in the form of aggregated statistics, such as the traffic generated by visits on various pages within our Site, and the habits and preferences of our audience. Such aggregated information does not include any information that would identify you personally. We may use such aggregated information and disclose it to third parties as we see fit. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other Disclosures  \n",
      "We reserve the right to release Personal Information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our Terms of Service, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our Site, the public, our customers, or of A.H. Belo. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that A.H. Belo, or the bulk of our assets relating to this Site, is acquired by another company, Personal Information about our visitors would be among the transferred assets. If you choose to unsubscribe from a specific advertiser's email program in response to an email message that we deliver, we will share your email address and opt-out instructions with the relevant advertiser to ensure that your email privacy preferences are honored. Similarly, if we ask a third-party company to send email offers for Belo products and services to its customers, we will share with that company a list of email addresses collected from visitors of our Site who have opted-out of our email program to ensure that their privacy preferences are honored. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Who is the Party Collecting Your Personal Information?\n",
      "\n",
      "This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and dissemination of information that we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose any information to other parties, whether through, for example, on-line auctions, chat rooms, forums, personal ads, interactive areas on the Site that allow you to submit and post your own content (such as stories, blogs, photos and videos), or the like, through third-party services or promotions offered on or through the Site, or through other websites throughout the Internet, different policies will apply and Belo will not be responsible for the use or dissemination of such information. The Site may offer message boards, chat rooms or other forums or interactive areas you can use to communicate with other computer users or Site visitors or to submit and post your own content. If you disclose personal information in one of these forums, this information can be viewed, collected, and used by others. Belo is not responsible for the use of information you disclose in these forums. We encourage you to consult the forum rules and the Terms of Service regarding the policies and procedures that apply to that portion of the Site.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Site may operate as part of a larger group of sites and may carry co-branded pages. In addition, other third-party sites may use the Site's name, A.H. Belo's name, or the name of one of A.H. Belo's affiliated companies. Since Belo does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies, if any, of such third parties, and Belo shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of your private information by such parties. Therefore, we encourage you to ask questions and review those parties' privacy policies before you disclose your Personal Information to others.\n",

      "To help make our Site more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we use a standard feature of browser software, called a \"cookie,\" to assign each visitor a unique, random numerical identification code that resides on their computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie can't read unrelated data off your hard drive.

Cookies enable our server to know that you are a registered user, and will eliminate the need for you to log in each time you access our Site. \n",
      "\n",
      "What are Web Beacons?   \n",
      "Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel or clear-pixel gifs) are invisible images that are used to assign cookies or access cookies assigned previously to a visitor's computer. We use Web beacons to access information about the pages visitors are viewing so we can recognize our returning users and analyze traffic patterns. We also work with a leading web analytics firm, Omniture, that places Web beacons on our Site and uses them in combination with cookies to collect, aggregate and analyze anonymous tracking information called \"session\" data on our behalf. This session information does not identify you personally and does not include your name, address, email address, telephone number or other Personal Information. We use this information to help us measure traffic and user behavior and count the number of unique visitors who view particular pages within our Site. If you wish to learn more about Omniture's privacy practices, you can visit http://www.omniture.com/privacy/product for more information. If you want to opt-out from the collection and analysis of your session data or if you want to uninstall an opt-out cookie from a prior visit (i.e., if you change your mind and decide to opt-in again to allow us to collect and analyze your session data), click here. Please note that you will need to opt-out separately before visiting our Site each time that you clear your cookies from your web browser or switch to a different computer or browser (e.g., if you previously opted-out of the use of Web beacons for us to collect and analyze your session data using the FireFox web browser but later visit our site using the Internet Explorer web browser, you will need to once again opt-out of the Web beacons). We use an advertising server developed by a third party to display ads on the Site. Some of these ads may contain cookies or Web beacons that are sent by third parties (e.g., advertisers or their advertising agencies) that we do not control. If you have questions regarding the data collection practices of any of the advertisers that appear on our Site, we encourage you to contact the applicable advertiser or review its privacy policy, which should be posted on the advertiser's website.\n",

We use Personal Information to improve our advertising and marketing efforts, to statistically analyze Site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to personalize the Site's content, layout, and services.

We may also use your Personal Information, such as your e-mail address, phone number or mailing address, to contact you regarding products and/or services that we think may be of interest to you, including products and services of third parties, unless you have elected not to receive these promotions and offers by modifying your profile as described below in \"How Can You Opt-Out of Sharing Your Personal Information or Receiving Our Promotional Communications?\"\n",

After registering on the Site, you may receive communications including mail, email, telephone or wireless short text messages from us related to products and services that we believe will interest you. Although we hope you find these communications informative and useful, you can always opt-out from receiving these types of communications from us by changing the privacy preferences in your member profile or by deleting your profile from our database.

      "Vendor and Service Providers  \n",
      "We have today, and will in the future have, arrangements with third-party vendors, such as credit card processors, shipping companies and fulfillment services that assist us with the operation of the Site or the services we offer through the Site. Occasionally, we will hire a third party to act on our behalf for projects such as market-research surveys and contest-entry or sweepstakes-entry processing. When you sign up for a service we offer, initiate a transaction, complete a survey or enter a contest or sweepstakes, we may be required to share Personal Information with one or more of our vendors. To protect your privacy, we do not authorize our vendors to retain, use or disclose your Personal Information for any purpose unrelated to the services that they provide for us or our users. To make our Site more valuable to our visitors, we may offer some services and features in conjunction with other service providers (\"Service Providers\"). For example, we may offer a car buying service, personalized finance and weather information alerts, sweepstakes offers or other promotions through cooperative arrangements with Service Providers that specialize in operating such services and features. If you choose to use these optional services or features, we may provide some of your Personal Information to one or more of our Service Providers. We will not do so without telling you in advance, and you can avoid having us make such disclosures by choosing not to use these services or features of the Site. Some of these Service Providers may also collect their own Personal Information in connection with providing the service. Their use of your information will be subject to the terms of their respective privacy policies, which you can find on their websites or obtain by contacting the Service Providers directly. Please refer to \"Who is the Party Collecting Your Personal Information?\" for additional information. \n",

      "Much of the information we collect is in the form of aggregated statistics, such as the traffic generated by visits on various pages within our Site, and the habits and preferences of our audience. Such aggregated information does not include any information that would identify you personally. We may use such aggregated information and disclose it to third parties as we see fit. \n",

      "We reserve the right to release Personal Information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our Terms of Service, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our Site, the public, our customers, or of A.H. Belo. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that A.H. Belo, or the bulk of our assets relating to this Site, is acquired by another company, Personal Information about our visitors would be among the transferred assets. If you choose to unsubscribe from a specific advertiser's email program in response to an email message that we deliver, we will share your email address and opt-out instructions with the relevant advertiser to ensure that your email privacy preferences are honored. Similarly, if we ask a third-party company to send email offers for Belo products and services to its customers, we will share with that company a list of email addresses collected from visitors of our Site who have opted-out of our email program to ensure that their privacy preferences are honored. \n",

The cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie can't read unrelated data off your hard drive. Our advertisers and the third parties that provide products or services through our Site may also assign their own cookies to your browser, a process that we don't control.\n",

      "Why does the Site use cookies?  \n",
      "We use cookies to track usage of the Site and further personalize your experience when you are visiting the Site. By tracking usage, we can best determine what features of the Site best serve our users. \n",
      "\n",
      "What benefits do I receive from cookies?   \n",
      "Overall, the use of cookies helps to give you a more personalized experience at the Site. The information is used to keep our Site fresh and relevant to you the user. Cookies also identify you to our server, allowing you to avoid retyping your e-mail address and password each time you access the Site.\n",

      "May I decline to accept a cookie?   \n",
      "You may decline to accept cookies sent by the Site by selecting an option on your browser to reject cookies.

Cookies enable our server to know that you are a registered user, and will eliminate the need for you to log in each time you access our Site. \n",

      "What are Web Beacons?   \n",
      "Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel or clear-pixel gifs) are invisible images that are used to assign cookies or access cookies assigned previously to a visitor's computer. We use Web beacons to access information about the pages visitors are viewing so we can recognize our returning users and analyze traffic patterns. We also work with a leading web analytics firm, Omniture, that places Web beacons on our Site and uses them in combination with cookies to collect, aggregate and analyze anonymous tracking information called \"session\" data on our behalf. This session information does not identify you personally and does not include your name, address, email address, telephone number or other Personal Information. We use this information to help us measure traffic and user behavior and count the number of unique visitors who view particular pages within our Site. If you wish to learn more about Omniture's privacy practices, you can visit http://www.omniture.com/privacy/product for more information. If you want to opt-out from the collection and analysis of your session data or if you want to uninstall an opt-out cookie from a prior visit (i.e., if you change your mind and decide to opt-in again to allow us to collect and analyze your session data), click here. Please note that you will need to opt-out separately before visiting our Site each time that you clear your cookies from your web browser or switch to a different computer or browser (e.g., if you previously opted-out of the use of Web beacons for us to collect and analyze your session data using the FireFox web browser but later visit our site using the Internet Explorer web browser, you will need to once again opt-out of the Web beacons). We use an advertising server developed by a third party to display ads on the Site. Some of these ads may contain cookies or Web beacons that are sent by third parties (e.g., advertisers or their advertising agencies) that we do not control. If you have questions regarding the data collection practices of any of the advertisers that appear on our Site, we encourage you to contact the applicable advertiser or review its privacy policy, which should be posted on the advertiser's website.\n",

After registering on the Site, you may receive communications including mail, email, telephone or wireless short text messages from us related to products and services that we believe will interest you. Although we hope you find these communications informative and useful, you can always opt-out from receiving these types of communications from us by changing the privacy preferences in your member profile or by deleting your profile from our database.

      "We have today, and will in the future have, arrangements with third-party vendors, such as credit card processors, shipping companies and fulfillment services that assist us with the operation of the Site or the services we offer through the Site. Occasionally, we will hire a third party to act on our behalf for projects such as market-research surveys and contest-entry or sweepstakes-entry processing. When you sign up for a service we offer, initiate a transaction, complete a survey or enter a contest or sweepstakes, we may be required to share Personal Information with one or more of our vendors. To protect your privacy, we do not authorize our vendors to retain, use or disclose your Personal Information for any purpose unrelated to the services that they provide for us or our users. To make our Site more valuable to our visitors, we may offer some services and features in conjunction with other service providers (\"Service Providers\"). For example, we may offer a car buying service, personalized finance and weather information alerts, sweepstakes offers or other promotions through cooperative arrangements with Service Providers that specialize in operating such services and features. If you choose to use these optional services or features, we may provide some of your Personal Information to one or more of our Service Providers. We will not do so without telling you in advance, and you can avoid having us make such disclosures by choosing not to use these services or features of the Site. Some of these Service Providers may also collect their own Personal Information in connection with providing the service. Their use of your information will be subject to the terms of their respective privacy policies, which you can find on their websites or obtain by contacting the Service Providers directly.

Belo, or the bulk of our assets relating to this Site, is acquired by another company, Personal Information about our visitors would be among the transferred assets. If you choose to unsubscribe from a specific advertiser's email program in response to an email message that we deliver, we will share your email address and opt-out instructions with the relevant advertiser to ensure that your email privacy preferences are honored. Similarly, if we ask a third-party company to send email offers for Belo products and services to its customers, we will share with that company a list of email addresses collected from visitors of our Site who have opted-out of our email program to ensure that their privacy preferences are honored. \n",

      "WB Acquisition Corporation, d/b/a Weatherbonk (\"WBAC\") is strongly committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy discloses how we collect, use and share information we gather about you on WBAC's Web sites and the choices you have regarding our use of and your ability to correct the information. This Privacy Policy applies only to WBAC's Web sites. We hope that this disclosure will enhance your experience on the Internet and reinforce the trust that you place in WBAC's services. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Information Collected Online\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the information provided by WBAC is offered without our collecting any personally identifiable information from you. For instance, you can view weather conditions in your hometown or anywhere in the world without giving out any personally identifiable information. In order to maximize your experience and to provide you with enhanced products and services, however, WBAC collects personally identifiable information (e.g., name, e-mail address, etc.) and demographic data (e.g., zip code, year of birth, interests, etc.) that you voluntarily supply to us. Some examples of instances when we collect personally identifiable information include when you: \n",
      "\n",
      "  * Wish to upload a webcam, photo or other content to our site;\n",
      "  * Register for a promotion, contest or sweepstakes;\n",
      "  * Send us an e-mail message or complete an inquiry form to receive additional information;\n",
      "  * Participate in an online forum or community, or post a blog; or \n",
      "  * Request us to deliver certain content from our site to your mobile or wireless device. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, you have a choice as to whether to provide your personally identifiable information. Although you are not required to disclose any personally identifiable information to us, portions of our Web site and other specialized services may be unavailable to you without such information. For instance, you will not be able to upload a webcam to our site without providing certain personally identifiable information on the webcam submission page of our site. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of participation in a chat session or blog posting, you are not required to provide any personally identifiable information. However, we do request that you enter a user name at your discretion. Also, the sessions are monitored and transcripts are posted on the Web site for access by other users. Any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily disclose online (e.g., in blog postings/discussion boards, in messages, chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be read, collected and used by others. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information that you choose to submit in these forums. \n",
      "\n",
      "## How We Use Your Information\n",
      "\n",
      "We use the information you provide in a limited number of ways. We may use the information to display information and advertisements that match your interests, notify you if you've won a contest or sweepstakes, and compile demographic statistics about our users. We may on occasion combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from other parties to enhance our ability to market to you those products or services that may be of interest to you. In addition, we may use your email address without your consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major WBAC Web site changes or for customer service purposes). \n",
      "\n",
      "## How We Share Your Information\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most valuable assets of our business is you. WBAC does not rent, sell or share personally identifiable information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except as described below. \n",
      "\n",
      "### WBAC and its Affiliates\n",
      "\n",
      "We provide you with the opportunity to opt in to receive special offers from WBAC and it affiliates. If you opt in, WBAC and its affiliates will use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products and services available from weatherbonk.com and its affiliates, including The Weather Channel, Inc. and WSI Corporation. These products may include, for example, schedules for special programs on The Weather Channel cable network or offers to purchase a calendar from The Weather Channel. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Third-Party Processors\n",
      "\n",
      "When you submit your personal information on the weatherbonk.com Web site, it may be shared with a selected third party (\"Third Party Processors\"). These Third Party Processors may organize, administer, process, and/or analyze data on our behalf to help us provide more relevant offers to you and to eliminate the delivery of duplicate offers. In addition, these Third Party Processors correct and/or update users' data based on information we provide them. We may also use Third Party Processors to deliver materials to you via e-mail or postal service. The data we provide to Third Party Processors is securely stored and maintained by them so that it can be accessed when needed for future purposes. Further, all such Third Party Processors are contractually bound by us to keep the information confidential. All information provided to Third Party Processors is used by them only to carry out the service they are providing for WBAC. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Links to Other Web Sites\n",
      "\n",
      "Like many Web sites on the Internet, WBAC links to pages located on Web sites maintained by various other entities not bound by our Privacy Policy. In some cases, you may link to pages of other Web sites that are framed with elements of weatherbonk.com, such as in the header or footer. The URL will identify the site you are visiting. We are not responsible for the information collection practices of other Web sites. The Privacy Policies of other organizations may differ from ours, for example, with respect to the level of security, use of cookies, and collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Purchase or Sale of Businesses\n",
      "\n",
      "WBAC continually looks for ways to improve our business. One such way of improving our business might be to buy or sell a company. If we buy or sell a business, databases containing personally identifiable information will likely be transferred as part of the sale. If we buy a business, we will honor the requests of that business' former customers regarding their personally identifiable information. If in connection with a sale there will be material changes to the way personally identifiable information is being used, affected consumers will be notified via e-mail and will be given the opportunity to opt-out. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Other Limitations on Privacy\n",
      "\n",
      "We may provide personally identifiable information without your permission (i) pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders; (ii) where WBAC believes our property or an individual's safety or security is at risk; (iii) if we find that your actions violate our Legal Restrictions and Terms of Use; or (iv) where otherwise required by law. \n",
      "\n",
      "## E-mail a Friend\n",
      "\n",
      "If you choose to use our service that allows you to e-mail a page of our site to a friend, in most circumstances, we do not have access to and do not collect any personally identifiable information regarding you or your friend. On certain pages of the site, we need to have access to your and your friend's e-mail addresses temporarily to send the e-mail due to technical requirements. This information is deleted as soon as the e-mail is sent and is not used for any other purpose. \n",
      "\n",
      "## IP Addresses, Cookies, Web Beacons, Gifs, and Information Saved by Other Technologies\n",
      "\n",
      "WBAC and Third Party Processors acting on our behalf uses various Internet technologies which help us to manage our site operations and track usage behavior so that we can tailor information and advertisements to make your visits more enjoyable and meaningful. These Internet technologies include: \n",
      "\n",
      "  * IP Addresses: random numbers assigned to individual computers which WBAC uses to administer our Web site and help diagnose problems with our servers. \n",
      "  * Cookies: small electronic files transferred from our Web site to your hard drive. Cookies enable WBAC to recognize repeat visitors, track usage behavior and facilitate your access to and use of our site. If you wish, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a Cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all Cookies. You can do this by resetting your browser (such as Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your Cookies. If you turn Cookies off, however, you won't have access to many of the features which make your experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly. \n",
      "  * Web Beacons (sometimes called single-pixel Gifs): electronic images that allow WBAC to count users who have visited certain Web pages we wish to track. For example, WBAC may include Web Beacons in promotional email messages in order to count how many messages have been opened and acted upon. Web Beacons may also be placed by our advertising partners on WBAC Web pages to help determine the effectiveness of Internet advertising campaigns. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Information that is collected via IP Address, Cookie and Web Beacon and other technologies is not personally identifiable. However, if you choose to provide WBAC with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in these technologies. In addition, we may share aggregate (not individual) site usage statistics and demographic information and other non-personally identifiable information with advertisers and other third parties, but this information will not include any personally identifiable information. Personal information about you as an individual will not be provided to any third party without your consent, except under the circumstances described above in the \"Third Party Processors\" and \"Other Limitations on Privacy\" sections.
